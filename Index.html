<p>
Welcome to the team! My name is Kyle Harrison and I'll be your Head Coach for the season. You can call me Coach or Coach K. I am very excited for what we will be doing this season and seeing you all improve as individual players and as a team. My goal for this team is simple, I plan to use your love for the game of basketball by teaching you the fundamentals such as passing, dribbling, shooting, defense, and communication. As a coach, I want to help each of you build on your skills, so that you can take your game to the next level. <br>
<p>
 To tell you a little bit about myself, I am 23 years old and I attend the University of Georgia.  I've been playing basketball since I was 7. I played recreational, I played middle school and in high school at Franklin County High school. I did not have the opportunity to play colllegiate basketball, so I switched to playing football so that  I could have a better chance of playing a sport at the next level. Changing sports for me did not mean I lost passion for the game but instead gaining more appreciaton for it and loving it even more once I was no longer playing. Thus the reasoning behind getting back into it. I follow a lot of teams. My favorite teams are Duke and the Los Angelos Lakers, with or without Kobe. I'm a fan of teams like the Warriors and the Spurs as well because of how well they play as a team on both sides of the ball and how they support one another. They do a lot of things I want to do as your coach, so I hope knowing that excites you because you could be the next Steph Curry or Kevin Durant on this team. I can't wait to get this seasoon started! I cant wait to meet you guys at practice! Let's Go!
